## üìú Abstract

Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to ensure safe and efficient navigation. To enhance safety and adaptability, predicted trajectories must align with human-like driving behavior. The **Human-Like Trajectory Prediction (HLTP)** model leverages a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework. The teacher model, equipped with an adaptive visual sector, mimics human brain visual processing (occipital and temporal lobes), while the student model focuses on real-time interaction and decision-making, reflecting functions of the prefrontal and parietal cortex. This dual-model approach dynamically adapts to evolving driving scenarios, capturing perceptual cues for precise prediction. Evaluated on the **Macao Connected and Autonomous Driving (MoCAD)** dataset, as well as **NGSIM** and **HighD** benchmarks, HLTP consistently outperforms existing models, especially in complex environments with incomplete data.

## üß† Framework

The HLTP‚Äôs teacher-student architecture involves:

- **Teacher Model**: Includes a Surround-Aware Encoder and Teacher Encoder, processing visual and context matrices to generate surround-aware and visual-aware vectors, which are then fed into the Teacher Multimodal Decoder. This enables the prediction of possible maneuvers for the target vehicle with associated probabilities.
- **Student Model**: Learned from the teacher model using a Knowledge Distillation Modulation (KDM) strategy, achieving accurate, human-like trajectory predictions even with minimal observational data.
